# **SMART MOVES REINVENTING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** 

---


## **Main Modules** :






## **Machine Learning Approaches** :

**1.Data Collection**
>1. Sensors
>2. Data Sources
--- 
**2. Data Preprocessing** 
>1. Data Cleaning 
>2. Normalization
--- 
**3. Feature Extraction Identify relevant features from the collected data, such as**
>1. Vehicle count in each lane
>2. Average speed of vehicles
>3. Presence of pedestrians
>4. Historical traffic patterns
---
***4. Machine Learning Model** 
>1. Train a machine learning model using historical data.
>2. Features could include time of day, day of the week, special events, and other relevant factors.
>3. The model learns the relationship between these features and the optimal signal timings.
---
**5. Real-time Prediction**
**6. Adaptive Signal Control**
>1. The predicted optimal signal timings are implemented in real-time to control the traffic signals
