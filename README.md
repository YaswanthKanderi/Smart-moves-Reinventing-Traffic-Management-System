# ** SMART MOVES REINVENTING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM **


Main Modules:






** Machine Learning Approaches: **
**1.Data Collection:  
> Sensors
> Data Sources
--- 
**2. Data Preprocessing 
 Data Cleaning 
 Normalization 
3. Feature Extraction Identify relevant features from the collected data, such as:
 Vehicle count in each lane 
 Average speed of vehicles 
 Presence of pedestrians 
 Historical traffic patterns
4. Machine Learning Model 
 Train a machine learning model using historical data.
 Features could include time of day, day of the week, special events, and other relevant factors.
 The model learns the relationship between these features and the optimal signal timings.
5. Real-time Prediction
6. Adaptive Signal Control:
 The predicted optimal signal timings are implemented in real-time to control the traffic signals
