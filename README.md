**1. Data Collection** :
>1. Responsible for collecting raw data from various sources such as sensors, cameras, and connected vehicles.
>2. This module ensures a continuous influx of real-time data for analysis.
---
**2. Data Preprocessing** :
>1. Handles the cleaning, filtering, and normalization of raw data to ensure its quality and consistency before further analysis.
>2. This step is crucial for accurate and reliable results.
---
**3. Traffic Pattern Analysis** :
>1. Utilizes algorithms and statistical models to analyze historical and real-time data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in traffic behavior.
---
**4.AI-Based Prediction** :
>1. Integrates machine learning algorithms to predict traffic conditions and congestion based on historical data, current trends, and external factors.
---
**5. Adaptive Traffic Control** :
>1. Implements an adaptive traffic signal control system that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on the analyzed traffic patterns and real-time conditions.
---
**6. Centralized Control and Decision-Making** :
> Establishes a centralized system that processes data from various sources, makes informed decisions, and
communicates instructions to the traffic infrastructure in real time.
---
Traffic Monitoring and Analytics :
 Monitors and analyzes the performance of the entire traffic management system, providing insights through
analytics on key metrics such as traffic flow, congestion levels, and system efficiency.
Object Detection :
 This module is responsible for detecting and identifying objects within the traffic environment, such as vehicles
type, vehicle count.
 It involves the use of computer vision techniques to process data from cameras or sensors and identify relevant
objects
